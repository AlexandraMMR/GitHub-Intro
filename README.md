# GitHub-Intro
This is a repo containing a pdf document of my slide deck for the .git intro workshop - thanks to @nicktikhonov for the material (you're a total legend!) Feel free to download or view this in the browser by clicking the pdf file :octocat: :sparkles:

# This will take you through the basic concepts of .git repositories 
## Remember there are some amazing resources under [GitHub Guides](http://guides.github.com) & you can do online on demand training in git & GitHub at [GitHub Training](http://training.github.com)

The key thing to remember is that version control is **SUPER** important - so make sure you learn how to do your A B C of git! 

**Adding** files to staging is a must or they won't be included in your repo! 

**Branching** is a lifesaver on group projects - so use it!

**Commit** when you want to save your status, if in doubt run ```git status``` to see your current changes & what files you have staged to be committed to the repo. 

# Another few handy hints

* Running ```git commit -m "insert commit message here"``` will save your commit with a handy message to remind you what that commit included, keep it simple & give yourself context - it will help when you have a large log of commits to look through

* Use ```git log --graph --pretty``` to get a nice graphical display in the command line of the change log & commits (super useful to see when branches have been created and merged :metal:).

* The reset option is super helpful & it's useful to know that even undos can be undone with git!

If you have any questions feel free to raise them as an issue on this repository & I will try my best to answer them for you!
